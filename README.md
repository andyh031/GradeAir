> #### *A Grading Application by Andy Hu*
>
Does it ever annoy you when you have no way of recalling how you did on 
that one test, or how you did on that final exam? Transcripts only show 
the final grade, but what if you wanted to see how you actually got that 
grade? This application will store all of your grades in a friendly and
aesthetically pleasing user-interface so that you can look back and see
how you performed in all of your classes, down to each assignment you
handed in and each test you wrote. Likewise, the primary target audience
for this application would be students currently in school. 

This project interests me because I have sometimes found myself handwriting
test scores I achieved in certain classes, since only the final grade would
remain on my transcript after I move up a grade. Not only that, the way that
your grades are displayed on a transcript is visually unappealing. These
factors motivated me to write an app that students, including me, could 
use to keep track of all of their grades in a more visually appealing way,
while simultaneously capturing the grades that went underneath the hood
to yield a final grade. 

> ## User Stories
- As a user, I want to add classes to my list of classes
  - As a user, I want to give traits to each of these classes (teacher, subject, year taken, weightings)
- As a user, I want to add grades to each of my classes
  - As a user, I want to separate each of these grades into assignments, tests, quizzes, etc.
- As a user, I want to see my classes displayed in different ways:
  - All my classes in a given year
  - All my classes specific to one subject
  - All my classes sorted by grade
- As a user, I want to have my GPA for each class be calculated by itself, both during the class (updates whenever I add a new grade) and when the class is over.
