> #### *A Grading Application by Andy Hu*
>
Does it ever annoy you when you have no way of recalling how you did on 
that one test, or how you did on that final exam? Transcripts only show 
the final grade, but what if you wanted to see how you actually got that 
grade? This application will store all of your grades in a friendly and
aesthetically pleasing user-interface so that you can look back and see
how you performed in all of your classes, down to each assignment you
handed in and each test you wrote. This application is meant to be used 
as a grade tracker, where you upload grades while the course is still 
in progress, and it will store these grades after the year is over
and you start a new school year. Likewise, the primary target audience
for this application would be students currently in school. 

This project interests me because I have sometimes found myself handwriting
test scores I achieved in certain classes, since only the final grade would
remain on my transcript after I move up a grade. Not only that, the way that
your grades are displayed on a transcript is visually unappealing. These
factors motivated me to write an app that students, including me, could 
use to keep track of all of their grades in a more visually appealing way,
while simultaneously capturing the grades that went underneath the hood
to yield a final grade.
